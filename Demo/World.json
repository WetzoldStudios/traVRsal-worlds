The arrows on the floor will guide you. Inside the labyrinth objects can be placed through rules. These can include constraints like targeting only corners, dead-ends or to set limits to the amount, minimum distance and more.",

            "What does go up, must come down. And gravity will do the job for you. Falling can be a great form of locomotion in itself. And also your demise.",

And I will get my electricity. Take care and bye bye."
